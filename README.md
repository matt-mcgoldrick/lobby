# lobby.io
lobby.io is a somewhat-curated aggregate site for FPS and BR related news.  Load it up between matches to catch up on recent announcements, read developer tweets, peek at the latest patch notes for your game of choice, and SO MUCH MORE

...well, almost. I'm currently in the process of building everything out. Just consider it to be in EARLY ACCESS, and not the DayZ standalone kind either.  I'll try my damnest to help this place reach its full potential.

The \*grand\* vision for this site is both as a casual place to check up on news, but also as a forum for discussion between players, developers, and streamers of any and all games in the FPS/BR genre.  

While reddit is fine for discussing a single game on its particular, relatively insular subreddit.  It is also overflowing with low quality, karma-farming, "check out this mousepad signed by NINJA!"-style posts.  I will try to avoid this by removing the karma system entirely, taking a different approach to moderation, and by simply attracting a better crowd of people who want to see a shift in the texture and tone of online discussion.

My hope is that lobby.io will be a place where A) players of different games can come together to discuss trends and the state of the industry as a whole and B) where people who care about game design, competitive or otherwise, can chat about topics that interest them and assist each other in building up their gaming skills.
